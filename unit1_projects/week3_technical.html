				<h1>mmm, javascript.</h1>
			<hr>
			<p>Javascript has become the premier client side language for web development and manipulating the contents of a page in your browser.  In this post, we'll examine:</p></br>
			<em>Why is Javascript popular?</br>
				What is it used for? </br>
				What makes it so cool?</em></br>
			<p>But first, let's see what the general googling public thinks of it:</p></br>
				<img class="pic" src="images/javascript_google.png" />
			<p>So I guess we can confirm that javascript is indeed popular, and also that many people find it confusing or hard to learn.  It's actually pretty simple and powerful and allows us to do all sorts of cool things on the web (for example: the twitter feed over to your right. ==></p>
			<p>But first, a little history lesson:</p>
			<p>Javascript was originally developed by Netscape (remember those guys) for use in their browser Netscape Navigator when they were competing from browser dominance with Microsoft Internet Explorer.  It was originally designed to be a lightweight complement to Java that would appeal to nonprofessional programmers and amatuer web developers.  It was designed to allow for the manipulation of elements on a page in the browswer and quickly gained widespread use and attention for its ease of implementation.  Microsoft eventually gave in and introduced JavaScript support in its browser, Internet Explorer 3.0, and now JavaScript has industry wide support on all browsers.</p>
			<p>Contributing to its popularity are the numerous tools developers can use to write and debug code in JavaScript, as well as, additions to its capabilities via jQuery, Node, and AJAX. 
			<p>AJAX is the lovely little tool we can thank for the making web a much less static-y place.  It allows for automatic refreshing and updating of pages and databases without leaving the page. We see this in action when someone posts something on facebook, or when our twitter feed updates without us telling it to.</p>
			<p>Thanks to the addition of Node.js, JavaScript can now dip its toes into the server side world of web development instead of having to rely on other technologies like PHP.</p>
			<p><strong>Fun Facts About JavaScript</strong></p>
			<p>1.  It was originally given the name "Mocha"</p>
			<p>2.  It supports something called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_typing">Duck Typing</a></p>
			<p>  3.  The JavaScript interpreter was originally called "SpiderMonkey", now it's known as "Rhino".</p>
			<p>4.  The widgets on your dashboard are made using JavaScript.</p>

			<p><strong>And happy coding!</strong></p>
