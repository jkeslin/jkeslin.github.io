<p>I've been a high school Math teacher for 6 years now. It's the hardest thing I've ever done, but has also been the great joy of my life so far.  I've met so many amazing kids and had an opportunity to share my love of math and science with any kid that'll listen.</p>

<p>Every group of kids I've taught in that six years has had a completely different character and mindset, which is why I bring this up.  I often wonder at the end of a long school day things like, "Why is my 2nd period class so much more fun to teach than my first?  Why are they learning more? Why does Eder work so hard even though he already has an A?  Why is my 3rd period so quiet?"</p>

<p>The answer to all these questions is that culture matters.  As a teacher I've seen a group of 30 kids who have a laundry list of struggles to worry about become energized and unified by the passion of a couple hard working students and acheive things that they could not have otherwise.  This is what drew me to Dev Bootcamp.  It feels like it was built by teachers.  And by teachers I mean, people who have found a way to communicate their passions with a large group and create a sense of unity.  When I read about dev bootcamp's curriculum or the structure of the classes or the emphasis on social learning (I'm terrified first of all) but I also feel like it was a program designed by lovers of teaching not just lovers of code.</p>

<p>Now I'm going back to being a student again and while I definitely have "imposter syndrome," as Shereef mentioned, I'm comforted by the fact that there's an emphasis on community and embracing our fears together.</p>

<p>I feel like Luke Skywalker when he picks up the lightsaber for the first time and doesn't really know what to do with it (and is at great risk of chopping his own arm off at any second).  But he's on the verge of having access to a great power, if he's willing to put in the work and recognize his own weaknesses and turn them into strengths with the help of others.</p>

<p>I've had the pleasure of watching a handful of my students accept this challenge over the last few years, and they've inspired me to do the same.  So I'm switching desks.</p>

<p>May the Force be with us all.</p>
