				<h1>what is rails?</h1>
			<hr>

			<p>So far throughout DBC we've been learning the Ruby programming language and have learned a number of things about object-oriented programming, etc.  What we haven't tackled yet, is working with Rails, or "Ruby on Rails."  So below I'll attempt to answer the questions, "What is Rails? What does it have to do with Ruby? And what do we use it for?"</p>
				
			<p>In short: Rails is a library of software that extends the Ruby programming language.  It's a framework for building websites and web apps.  It combines Ruby with HTML, CSS, and Javascript to create web applications that run on a web server.  This classifies it as a server-side, or "back-end" development platform.</p>
			
			<p>The beauty of Rails, and what makes it more than just a software library, is that it has a vast community of developers that value open-source development and sharing their work to make building complex websites and applications easier.  This pool of open source software makes Rails a popular tool among tech startups because it allows them to get their products up and running quickly.</p>

		
			<p>Rails has a few guiding principals that make it unique and have been the backbone of its growth in recent years.  I'll describe them briefly below, using some wisdom from Rails developer and author, Daniel Kehoe:</p>

			<p>1.  Rails is opinionated.  In other words, there's a "Rails way" of doing things.  Following these conventions makes it easier for work to be shared amongst the Rails community.</p>
			<p>2.  Rails is Omakase.  That's Japanese for, "I'll leave it to you."  As in, if you were to say to the chef of your favorite restuarant, instead of ordering from the menu, "I trust you, cook me some delicious, and I'll eat it."  Basically, the Rails API is the work of a master chef, and if you trust it, it'll serve you well.</p>
			<p>3.  Don't Repeat Yourself, aka "DRY".  It is conventional within the Ruby on Rails community to ensure that code avoids duplication, and is short and simple and easily shared with others.</p>

			<p>Of course, this is only the tip of the Rails iceberg.  For more information on Rails, check out this tutorial: <a href="http://www.tutorialspoint.com/ruby-on-rails/rails-introduction.htm">TutorialsPoint Rails Introduction</a>.  Or if you're feeling ambitious, check out the Rails API right here: <a href="http://api.rubyonrails.org/">Rails API</a>.</p>

			<p><strong>Oh, and happy coding!</strong></p>
