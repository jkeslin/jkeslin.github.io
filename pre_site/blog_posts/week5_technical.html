				<h1>classes and inheritance</h1>
			<hr>
			<p>An essential part of working with the Ruby programming language is understanding the relationships between classes, objects, instances, and methods. To try and better understand them and the heirarcies associated with them, let's us an analogy from the animal kingdom, and our furry friends, cats and dogs.</p>
				
			<p>Cats and dogs can both be described as mammals.  Therefore, any properties that mammals have, cats and dogs (despite their differences) must have all those properties.  For example, they are: warm-blooded, breathe air, and produce milk, etc. But still, not all dogs are the same, and not all mammals are the same.  So let's write a program that define's what these animals are like and hopefully it'll act as a model of how different objects in Ruby are formed.  See the code below:</p>

			<img class="picsm" src="../unit1_projects/images/mammal_class.png" />
			
			<p>So what we've done is we have created the class "Mammal" that has methods that tell it to have warm-blood, breathe air, and produce milk.  Then we have two separate classes ("Dog" and "Cat") that get to <strong>inherit</strong> all the properties of Mammals, but they have their own methods that show how they speak differently. Cat and Dog are now <strong>subclasses</strong> of the <strong>superclass</strong>: Mammal.  If that is in fact true, the following code should show us that cats and dogs have access to the methods in Mammal as well as their own class:</p>

			<img class="picsm" src="../unit1_projects/images/sprinkles_rover.png" />
		
			<p>So far we've got Mammals as a superclass, and Cat and Dog are both subclasses. So what does that make our friends Sprinkles and Rover? Sprinkles is an <strong>instance</strong> of the Cat class, and Rover is an <strong>instance</strong> of the Dog class.  Let's take it a step further and create a breed of dog named German Shepherd, and determine if that breed is fit for guard duty:</p>

			<img class="pic" src="../unit1_projects/images/breed_class.png" />

			<p>So now we've created another subclass called "Breed" that has access to all the methods in the Dog and Mammal class.  And we've created an instance of breed called german_shepherd that has the input parameters: breed, color, and size. The "@" symbol, signifies that we've created an <strong>instance variable</strong>.  Instance variables in this case, are ways to give values to the instance, german_shepherd, but not to the entire Breed class.  In the code above you can see we were able to access the guard, speak, and blood_type methods thanks to our class heirarcy and inheritance.</p>
