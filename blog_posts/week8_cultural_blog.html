				<h1 class="article-name">dealing with conflict</h1>
			<hr>
		<article class ="expand">

			<p>In thinking about how I deal with (or don't deal with) conflict, I seem to find my actions all over the North, East, and South end of the compass to the right.  I don't see myself as someone who lashes out at others or tries to "turn the tables," but other than that I can think of many times that I've dealt with conflict on the other side of the compass.  My first instinct when faced with a conflict is to avoid it, or withdrawal myself from it.  For as long as possible I'll pretend that it doesn't exist, or naively think that it'll go away or solve itself.  Obviously this is not a productive form of conflict resolution, but it's a tough habit to break.</p>
				
			<p>As anyone who's been in a relationship knows, conflicts can arise often and it takes strength and patience to resolve them.  I'll spare you the details of my own conflicts and instead skip to some things that I've learned from them:</p>

			<p>1.  Take time to listen.</p>
			<p>2.  Assume good intentions of others.</p>
			<p>3.  Be honest with yourself and others about what you're feeling.</p>
			<p>4.  Don't make it personal.</p>
			<p>5.  Don't try to win.  Sometimes the solution is just that you understand each other.  Not that you determine who was right and who was wrong.</p>
