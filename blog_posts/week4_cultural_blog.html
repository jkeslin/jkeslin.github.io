			<p>Six years ago I became a math teacher because I thought math was cool and I wanted teenagers who were about to embark on a journey to college to think the same thing.  I also felt it was my duty to do so because I had been on the other side and seen what our job market looks like for people who struggle with math. I wanted kids to know that it's a powerful tool and that it can be an enjoyable part of their future career.  I'm leaving teaching now to do some of my own learning, but I see the same sort of phenomenon happening, in that there is another powerful tool out there (coding) that kids aren't equipt with.</p>
				
			<p>We already live in a time where the tech world has a shortage of talent to fill their job openings (hence the existence of DBC) and it seems that this will continue until the average public school realizes that coding is something they should be teaching their kids. My fear is that kids who are in school now are in this unfortunate era where coding skill has become essential to our society, but schools haven't figured out they need to teach it yet.  They may find themselves, in a decade or so, being the only people looking for jobs who don't have experience with coding.</p>
			<p>This ill timing reminds me of my dad, who is a brilliant guy and a talented engineer but was educated in a time before people realized that typing would be an essential skill for the future.  Despite his years of work experience and vast intelligence he still types with his two index fingers and it takes him forever to write a simple email!</p>
			
			<p>This isn't a life or death situation for him, and not being able to code probably isn't for my students either, but it stinks to know how much more powerful they could be if they could code. It takes a long time for our schools to adapt to changes in our economies and my students might unfortunately be in high school at just the wrong time.</p>
