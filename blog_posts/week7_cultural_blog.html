			<p>Stereotype threat is when a person is a risk of confirming a negative stereotype about one's group.  The term was first used in the research by Steele and Aronson in their 1995 paper detailing experiments where Black college freshman performed more poorly on standardized tests than White students if their race was emphasized before or during the test.</p>
				
			<p>As a White male, I have to accept that I've lived in a world where it's easy for me to live a life of privilege.  So I will not attempt to speak to my own experiences with stereotype threat, despite that everyone has been subject to other people's biases one way or another.  I can however speak about how I've seen my high school students in Chicago become subject to stereotype threat.</p>

			<p>For six years I've taught math at schools in urban areas with a disproportionate amount of youth who have lived in poverty, or in neighborhoods mostly known for their criminal or gang related activity.  Many of them walk into my classroom with the idea that they were somehow designed to underperform, and that it's not something they can control.  And that this idea of going to college that their teachers keep talking about, is just something for someone else.  I've seen a lot of kids ignore this threat and accomplish great things, and I've seen kids who couldn't overcome what they thought was a genetic or social disposition to not achieve and drop out of school.  It's heartbreaking to see, and is one of the things that makes teaching such a tough job to make sustainable.</p>
			
			<p>As far as how this might apply to anyone, or how it may present itself in the tech world:  I think we can all be better off if we just make an effort to understand our own biases and truly get to know someone before we make decisions about his/her character. And really know when you don't really know someone, or when you might not really know yourself.</p>
