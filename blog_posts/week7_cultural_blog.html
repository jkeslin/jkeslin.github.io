				<h1>meaningful work</h1>
			<hr>
			
			<p>The value I chose is "meaningful work."  The prompt asked, which times do I feel the happiest, proudest, or most satisfied.  When I read that question I immediately thought about the days were I felt like a good teacher and felt like the hard work I had done made a positive impace somewhere.  But even on a smaller scale, I get a lot of joy from accomplishing little things like, writing a cool sports stats related program in excel, or making a repair in my apartment, or even just going to the gym.  Knowing that I accomplished something positive on a given day brings me genuine sense of joy and satisfaction.</p>
				
			<p>In general, do I live up to the value of doing "meaningful work"? According to the scale we're given:</p>

			<p><em>
			Disagree 1 ---- 2 ---- 3 ---- 4 ---- 5 Agree
			</em></p>

			<p>I would say that I fall somewhere around a 3.5 (although this is obviously a difficult thing to quantify). I think the work teachers do is extremely meaningful and I specifically left Engineering to pursue teaching for that reason.  But on a day to day basis, do I really make an effort to ensure that my work is meaningful?  I know there are lots of times that I don't. There were plenty of days that I just wanted to count down the seconds to the closing bell at 4:00pm instead of thinking of better ways to serve my students. And plenty of days where I just want to sit at home and watch baseball and drink whiskey and then get up the next day and do the same thing.</p>

			<p>One thing I've noticed about my own drive to do meaningful work, is that when I'm having a day where I'm feeling unmotivated to live up to this value, it can all be changed by starting with a small act.  My most productive days as a coder (in my short time in DBC for example) or as a teacher, or a student, all started with me completing some sort of tiny but gratifying project.  That may be putting grades in a grade book, or washing the dishes, or doing 100 pushups.  But once I have a small sense of the satisfaction that comes with completing a task that I find meaningful, I find myself on a roll for the rest of the day.</p>
			
			<p>During my time at DBC, I'm going to make an effort to start each day with a small victory, and then ask myself if I'm approaching my work in a way that the process or outcome is meaningful.  And hopefully the answer will be YES, or that I'll have the strength to redirect myself.</p>
